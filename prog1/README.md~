##Project 1

1. Write a non-recursive routine to compute the factorial of n according to Equation (2.3). Calculate the running time predicted by the detailed model given in Section (\#secmodeldetailed) and the simplified model given in Section (\#secmodelsimplified).

The book outlines the detailed computer model, the basic Axioms of which can be found [here](http://brpreiss.com/books/opus4/html/page36.html). To calculate the total running time of the program, we simply translate each statement in the program to its corresponding constant. Taking from our non-recursive-factorial.cpp...
